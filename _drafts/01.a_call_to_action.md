title: In Which a Call to Action is Made
---

It was the first day of work for Jesse, the new intern at PenultimateWidgets, one of the best employers in town. Jesse had a fresh new computer science degree and was itching to get into the real world. Unfortunately, as good an employer as PenultimateWidgets was, they were known around the Springfield campus a bit blue collar for IT jobs: good job security (the company has been around forever), but not the most exciting work. "Not to worry," Jesse thought. "I can always do open source to scratch the cutting edge itch."

However, when Jesse arrived, dressed for the First Day of Work, the place was in chaos. The receptionist, sporting a "Logan" name tag,  barely looked up before redirecting Jesse to a conference room to fill out paperwork before a further shuffle towards the IT department. "Here is your cubicle--someone will be around shortly to give you the inception." Logan paused. "Sorry it's so crazy today, but the company founder has called an all-hands meeting this morning, and no one knows what it's about. Good luck."
