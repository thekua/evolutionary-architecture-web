* themes
** Let's experiment!
* outline
** 01. In which a call to action is made
*** first day for intern 
Told as a company-wide meeting
- explains where the name came from
- now the name has become prophetic
- ends with brainstorming on what to do
** Attack plan
- Migrate some critical systems
- build microservices for new stuff
- finding seams
- improving the modularity of what's already there
** the spreadsheet
*** aspirational goals in a spreadsheet
*** discover the Building Evolutionary Architectures book
*** fitness functions over spreadsheets
** building a demonstration defeats discussion POC
- include database migrations, machine provisioning
- including deployment pipeline (from book)
- automation FTW
** adding fitness function for cycles
*** They decide that time to market is important
*** spawns a discussion of process fitness function vs. tests
** splitting operations into container substrate w/ containers on teams
*** team autonomy
*** service meshes
** what to port? 
*** can't decide what to port from the old Swing application
*** experiment
** chasing complexity
- tries a dumb solution on the backend--foiled by fitness functions
- tried the same solution on the front end--foiled by fitness function
- introduce pairing as a teaching tool
** inverse conway maneuver after switching teams to microservices
describes an experiment in messaging overhead
** Anemic BA problem
** swapping star rating
*** a success story using Scientist of incremental change
*** encourages experimentation by Ashley on smart widgets
** reporting & eventual consistency
*** talking business people out of transactions
*** realizing that separation of concerns simplifies everything
** Legality of open source libraries
** Goldilocks governance
*** selective scale because of microservices isolation
** DBA journey
** reuse at PenultimateWidgets
** crisis!
** tech lead journey
** QA journey
** EA at PenultimateWidgets
*** deployment pipeline as a governance vector
*** broadcasting governance using tech radar
** zero-day security fitness functions
** merger with another company
- incorporating alien artifacts
- legacy in a box
- selective use of ESB
** selling the platform
- include selling platform w/ deployment pipeline & fitness functions in place
** open ultimate widgets
a sudden market shift allows then to pivot to SmartWidgets and use open source as a leverage
