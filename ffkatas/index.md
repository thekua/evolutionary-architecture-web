# Architectural Katas

_inspired by Ted Neward's original [Architectural Katas](https://archkatas.herokuapp.com)_

	  "How do we get great designers?
	  Great designers design,
	  of course."
                              Fred Brooks

	  "So how are we supposed to get great architects, if
	  they only get the chance  to architect fewer than
	  a half-dozen times in their career?"

                             Ted Neward

## About

Architectural Katas are intended as a small-group (3-5 people) exercise, usually as part of a larger group (4-10 groups are ideal), each of whom is doing a different kata. A Moderator keeps track of time, assigns Katas (or allows this website to choose one randomly), and acts as the facilitator for the exercise.

The Architectural Katas started as a presentation workshop by Ted Neward. They've taken on a life of their own. [Learn more &raquo;]({{ site.url }}/archkatas/about.html)

## Rules

Doing an Architectural Kata requires you to obey a few rules in order to get the maximum out of the activity. [Read Rules &raquo;]({{ site.url }}/archkatas/rules.html)


## Lead

Want to run the Architectural Katas yourself? There's only a few things you need to know before you do. Ted Neward, the originator of Architectural Katas, has information on his site about leading Katas exercises. [Read on the original site &raquo;](https://archkatas.herokuapp.com/lead.html)
