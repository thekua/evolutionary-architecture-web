title: No More View Models
description: PenultimateWidgets has a group of developers who cut their teeth on mainframe programming, where all work is done via a terminal. They have (mostly) switched to modern web development, but architects find that they often create models and workflows directly in web pages rather than support a cleaner MVC separation, and they would like to discourage this behavior.
categories: atomic, triggered
requirements:
    - no model or controller code may appear in view pages
context:
    - developers are using Java or .NET on the server side
solution:
    - use PMD (https://pmd.github.io/) or Language server protocol (https://langserver.org/) to build a tool that scans which classes developers instantiate in view code
    - build a list of restricted model and controller packages
    - if any view code instantiates a class from the restricted list, fail the build
