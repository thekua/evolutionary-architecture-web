title: Deterministic Distributability
description: "PenultimateWidgets has been burned in the past by hard-coded strings in applications that tie applications to a particular data center location. They want to ensure this doesn't happen in the future."
categories: atomic, triggered
requirements:
    - Ensure that no data center location is embedded within an application
context:
    - PenultimateWidgets uses several different data centers, distributed geographically.
solution:
    - Require that developers use configuration files for all database configuration (using tools like ArchUnit)
    - During testing, randomly switch database configurations between tests across several working instances
