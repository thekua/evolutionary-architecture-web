title: Audit the Accounting
description: PenultimateWidgets has been a Bad Company (cheating on some complex accounting rules), but they have reformed their ways and paid their penalties. Now, however, as part of the settlement, they agree to put auditing measures in place around code that handles accounting rules. State auditors come once a quarter to look everything over, but PenultimateWidgets has found it too much of a chore to delay preparation until near audit time; they want a more automated way to verify things.
categories: atomic, triggered and manual
requirements:
    - all code that affects accounting must be limited to a certain set of packages/namespaces
    - code in those packages must be flagged as affected when changes occur
context:
    - the team uses git for version control
solution:
    - During check-in, look at git logs to see if any files in the affected packages were modified
    - for any modified file, add it to a database of files to check by the auditors
    - the tech lead code reviews changes for the last week before standup
    - at audit time, show each of the changed files to auditors and allow them access to the repository to verify that no other files were changed
