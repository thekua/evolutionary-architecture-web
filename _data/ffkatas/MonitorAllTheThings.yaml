title: Monitor All The Things
description: PenultimateWidgets wants to ensure that Java and .NET applications support monitoring.
categories: atomic, continuous
requirements:
    - All Java applications in all environments must support monitoring by the chosen tool
context:
    - all projects run a deployment pipeline
    - the deployment pipeline uses automated machine provisioning for all environments
solution:
    - create a test during the pre-flight building of the machine image to ensure monitoring ports are listening properly
    - fail the build if any development team skipped or mis-configured monitoring
