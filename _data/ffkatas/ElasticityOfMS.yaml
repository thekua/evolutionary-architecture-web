title: Elasticity of Microservices
description: PenultimateWidgets utilizes a microservices architecture and want to ensure that as new requests appear that the architecture elastically scales.
categories: atomic, triggered
requirements:
    - For microservices determined to need it, they should support elastic scale
    - As the number of requests excedes the defined threshold, the service discovery tool creates more instances and dispatches requests
context:
    - PenultimateWidgets microservices use a common service template that handles discovery 
solution:
    - build a Hello, World service to allow instantiation of the service template
    - deploy the service and direct enough requests to it to trigger elasticity in the naming service
    - verify that the number of instances rose properly
