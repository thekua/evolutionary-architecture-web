title: Avoid Complex Code
description: "PenultimateWidgets has recently hired many new graduates and interns. During code reviews and pairing, more senior developers notice a tendency towards overly complex code, including long methods and classes. They need fitness function(s) to control this."
scope: server-side code in both Java and .NET and client-side JavaScript
requirements:
    - validate that methods do not become overly long
    - validate that classes do not carry too much responsibility
    - validate that classes have good cohesion
context:
    - PenultimateWidgets will pay for tools if necessary
    - PenultimateWidgets is willing to slow down velocity to improve code quality
solution:
    - build cyclomatic complexity checks in the deployment pipeline for both server and client-side code
    - find LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) tools for supported platforms (https://maisqual.squoring.com/wiki/index.php/Lack_of_Cohesion_in_Methods)
    - Set a threshold for the RFC metric (https://maisqual.squoring.com/wiki/index.php/Response_For_a_Class) and find appropriate tools
