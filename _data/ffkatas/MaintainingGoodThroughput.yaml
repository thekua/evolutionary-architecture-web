title: Maintaining Good Throughput
description: "PenultimateWidgets is proud of how popular their website has become and want to make sure they maintain good throughput: a combination of performance and scalability."
categories: holistic, continuous
requirements:
    - the enterprise architects have defined thresholds for acceptable performance degradation under scale, and the architecture should maintain performance and scale within those parameters
context:
    - the architecture support good incremental change and modern DevOps practices
solution:
    - build a run-time monitor that reports on number of instances, performance per instance and overall
    - if performance or scalability violates the established thresholds, raise an alarm
