title: A11y All the Things
description: PenultimateWidgets has decided that all new development of user interfaces must support accessibility, both web and desktop. Because this is a new initiative for developers, architects fear they will forget to do this and thus want safeguards.
categories: atomic, triggered
requirements:
    - all new web development must support accessibility
    - all new Java Swing development must support accessibility
context:
    - all UX is in either Java Swing or Javascript
solution:
    - add a fitness function to the deployment pipeline for web projects that runs pa11y (http://pa11y.org/) to ensure compliance
    - for Java, use PMD to check code within the user interface and look for control instantiation
    - check to make sure every control has the AccessibleName property set
