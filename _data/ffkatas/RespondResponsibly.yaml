title: Respond Responsibly
description: "PenultimateWidgets business analysts are worried about one of their key competitors, who has a very fast website. PenultimateWidgets website has traditionally not featured speed; they want to ensure that the responsiveness doesn't get worse."
categories: holistic, triggered
requirements:
    - Establish a responsiveness service-level agreement for each major page
    - Ensure that no page drops below their threshold
context:
    - All PenultimateWidgets websites are structured well enough to allow some degree of automated testing.
solution:
    - Spin up a build in an integration environment with representative data
    - Use an automated testing tool (such as Selenium or Watir) to automate visiting the pages with an SLA
    - Time the rendering of the page (using a tool such as Watchtower)
    - Fail the build if the response time exceeds the threshold
