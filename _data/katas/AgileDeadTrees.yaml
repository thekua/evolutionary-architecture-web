title: Agile Dead Trees
description: A publisher wants to unify its authoring Content Management System (CMS) and customer store experience, trying to get books published to customers as quickly as possible.
users: dozens of publisher employees, hundreds of authors, thousands/millions of customers
requirements:
    - authors publish chapters
    - reviewers see the chapters, make review comments, and notify authors on review
    - authors can reject proposed review changes
    - supports both copy and technical editing
    - customers can buy books (either e- form or dead trees form) online, including those available in 'beta'
    - publisher can push authors' chapters to those customers who bought the 'beta'
context:
    - The business is driven to this decision because competitors have a similar offering.
    - Competition for authors is tight.
    - This is part of a long-term strategy to modernize the publishing aspects of the business.
    - Information needed to publish a book (distribution, royalties, marketing) comes from several disparate systems, ranging from emailed Excel spreadsheets to mainframe integration with the printing facility.
