title: "E(xperimental) College"
description: "Local college now offers unique non-credit courses in addition to the usual grad/undergrad courses, and they need a registration and payment system"
users: students, college users, admin, and accounting
requirements:
    - existing central student/class registry is NOT integratable--only https web form access allowed
    - accept payments
    - track registrations
    - non-credit registrations must be duplicated in central registry (but not by hand!)
    - students enter the central registry if their payment succeeds
    - updates/deletes from the central registry is okay as a manual process but preferably automated
    - payments can be credit card, bank account withdrawal, check or cash
    - course prereqs
    - students can request invoice/receipts and/or transcripts (which should be emailed)
    - multiple students register for multiple classes with one purchase
    - admins must see course lists, payments, but not student personal info
context:
    - very little budget for IT
    - "'How do they register and pay?' was a neglected requirement for many months"
    - hard deadline for class registration in 6 months
