title: World of Webcraft
description: An entertainment company wants a first-person shooter MMORPG game delivered through the browser
users: millions+ (they hope)
requirements:
    - users choose the map they want to play in, then duke it out with randomly-selected players of roughly equal skill
    - players can 'trick out' their characters with skills/equipment by sending the company money
    - usable from any 'modern' Web browser
    - full-immersion experience (sound, graphics, etc)
    - players can 'chat' (trash talk) to other players, but only those 'within range'
    - players can create invitation-only tournaments
    - guests can observe all the players without being seen/interact (ghosts)
    - players can create new maps, weapons, and rules
context:
    - gaming performance is high priority, but scalability even more so
    - if this game is successful, the company plans to extract the good bits as a framework they can sell
    - biggest expense are the highly skilled artists creating the visual look and feel
