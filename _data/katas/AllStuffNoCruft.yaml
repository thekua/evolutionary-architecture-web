title: All Stuff, No Cruft
description: Conference organizer needs a management system for the conferences he runs for both speakers and attendees
users: hundreds of speakers, dozens of event staff, thousands of attendees
requirements:
    - attendees can access speaking schedule online, including room assignments
    - speakers can manage talks (enter, edit, modify)
    - attendees 'vote up/down' talks
    - organizer can notify attendees of schedule changes up-to-the-minute (if attendees opt in)
    - each conference (being a different subject) can be branded independently
    - speaker slides are accessible online only to attendees
    - evaluation system via web page, email, SMS, or phone
context:
    - Conference runs across the US.
    - Very small support staff.
    - "'Bursty' traffic: extremely busy when conference is occurring."
    - "Conference organizer wants to easily 'skin' the site for different technology offerings."
