title: Hot Diggety Dog!
description: "Local hot dog stand merchant wants a point-of-sale system for his hot dog stand operators"
users: fifty or so hot dog stand operators, thousands of customers in the local area (via social-media)
requirements:
    - must be lightweight in size--laptop is too unwieldy to use efficiently when making hot dogs on the street
    - allow for discounts
    - track sales by time and location
    - send inventory updates to mobile inventory-management staff (who drive to the location with supplies)
    - provide a social-media integration so customers can be notified when a hot dog stand is nearby
    - export information in format importable by accounting tools
context:
    - forced into undertaking this development because the current hodgepodge ways of tracking sales requires too much manual effort
    - time to completion is important
    - "building a solution that won't need replacement in 3 years is more important"
    - no serious budget constraints
