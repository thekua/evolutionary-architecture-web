# Architectural Katas

## About

Architectural Katas are intended as a small-group (3-5 people) exercise, usually as part of a larger group (4-10 groups are ideal), each of whom is doing a different kata. A Moderator keeps track of time, assigns Katas (or allows this website to choose one randomly), and acts as the facilitator for the exercise.


Each group is given a project (in many ways, an RFP--Request For Proposal) that needs development. The project team meets for a while, discovers requirements that aren't in the orignal proposal by asking questions of the "customer" (the Moderator),  discusses technology options that could work, and sketches out a rough vision of what the solution could look like. Then, after they've discussed for a while, the project team must present their solution to the other project teams in the room, and answer challenges (in the form of hard-but-fair questions) from the other project teams. Once that challenge phase is done, the room votes on their results, and the next project team takes the floor.

## History          	

From the creator of the [original Katas site](https://archkatas.herokuapp.com), Ted Neward:

> The Architectural Katas were born out of a simple desire: software architects need a chance to practice being software architects, just as programmers need a chance to practice being programmers. Dave Thomas created the concept of the "Code Kata" while watching his son at karate practice, and that turned out to be a popular concept: a series of exercises that programmers can attempt in a variety of different languages, as a way to help master the language.

> A few years later, while contemplating what kind of workshop I could run at a Java/Open Source/Agile conference, I thought about combining Code Katas but at a higher level. Some Google searches made it pretty apparent that nobody had tried this before, so... what the hell? Let's give it a shot.

> The Architectural Katas ran for 18 months straight, and each time they ran, they were a huge success--most participants found them useful, regardless of skill level. Experienced architects thought they were a great way to try something different; novice architects loved the chance to try something without the pain of failing; and senior developers who'd never really known what architecting was like found it an easy way to get a glimpse of the architecture exercise.
