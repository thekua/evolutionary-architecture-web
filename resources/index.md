## Resources

We discuss many resources in the _Building Evolutionary Architectures_ workshops, and we continue to find more tools that fall into our categorization of fitness functions.

* [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/)    
ArchUnit is a free, simple and extensible library for checking the architecture of your Java code using any plain Java unit test framework. 

* [CKJM](https://www.spinellis.gr/sw/ckjm/)    
The program ckjm calculates Chidamber and Kemerer object-oriented metrics by processing the bytecode of compiled Java files. The program calculates for each class the following six metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer.

    WMC: Weighted methods per class  
    DIT: Depth of Inheritance Tree  
    NOC: Number of Children  
    CBO: Coupling between object classes  
    RFC: Response for a Class  
    LCOM: Lack of cohesion in methods  

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)    
ESLint is an open source project that provides a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript.
