## Resources

We discuss many resources in the _Building Evolutionary Architectures_ workshops, and we continue to find more tools that fall into our categorization of fitness functions.

### Presentations _NOT_ by the Authors

* [Evolutionary UI: Change as a first-class citizen in the modern frontend world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5915WUFazjo)    
by Rufus Raghunath and Giamir Buoncristiani

Allowing for change is especially important when designing your frontend applications, where ever higher user expectations meet the fast-paced JavaScript ecosystem.

In this talk, we will show how the principles of evolutionary architecture can be applied to UI to prioritize changeability. We’ll consider several approaches to making a modern UI application more evolvable, such as the microfrontends pattern, and examine specific “fitness functions” that will keep you and your team honest to your requirements without sacrificing evolvability. We’ll also discuss the tradeoffs you make when you choose a more evolutionary frontend architecture, and provide a framework for thinking about how much future change you’ll need to account for.

### Software

* [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/)    
ArchUnit is a free, simple and extensible library for checking the architecture of your Java code using any plain Java unit test framework. 

* [CKJM](https://www.spinellis.gr/sw/ckjm/)    
The program ckjm calculates Chidamber and Kemerer object-oriented metrics by processing the bytecode of compiled Java files. The program calculates for each class the following six metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer.

    WMC: Weighted methods per class  
    DIT: Depth of Inheritance Tree  
    NOC: Number of Children  
    CBO: Coupling between object classes  
    RFC: Response for a Class  
    LCOM: Lack of cohesion in methods  

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)    
ESLint is an open source project that provides a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript.

* [JavaNCSS](https://github.com/codehaus/javancss)    
Metrics suite for Java.


* [Nagios](https://www.nagios.com/)    
State-of-the-art commercial monitoring tool.

* [NetArchTest](https://github.com/BenMorris/NetArchTest)    
A fluent API for .Net that can enforce architectural rules in unit tests.

* [Netflix Simian Army](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy)    
Tools for keeping your cloud operating in top form. Chaos Monkey is a resiliency tool that helps applications tolerate random instance failures.

* [Pa11y.org](http://pa11y.org/)   
A command-line interface which loads web pages and highlights any accessibility issues it finds. Useful for when you want to run a one-off test against a web page.

* [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/)    
An extensible cross-language static code analyzer.
